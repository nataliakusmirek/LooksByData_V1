# LooksByData
ðŸ¤– Uses web crawlers to gather data on popular fashion trends and use the data to train an AI model named F.A.T.E. (Fashion and Trend Estimator) to make "currently trending" outfits based on current trends/commonalities in the industry. 
 
ðŸ’» The outfits recommended by F.A.T.E. are descriptive, and not specific to any brand. This was done to make sure F.A.T.E. did not exhibit socioeconomic biases of any sort in its curation.
